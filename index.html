  <p>Hi, welcome to my portfolio page! I thought I would keep it straight forward and just show you what I worked on during my half year with Dark Tech.</p>
  
  <p>Within Dark Tech, me and some friends worked on a controlling wearable product. I was in charge of many of the major decisions and designs of the project. Here is a global list of my contributions:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Design and fabrication of all 3 primary prototypes of the project.</li>
    <li>Designing all needed hardware connections within the project.</li>
    <li>Multiple custom prototype circuit boards.</li>
    <li>All onscreen graphics.</li>
    <li>First version of slot machine code for Society 5.0 expo.</li>
    <li>Hardware interfacing code.</li>
    <li>Consulting for design of program structure and layout.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>It has been a fun project so here are some pictures of the end result!</p>

  <p>This is the product I helped develop. You are supposed to wear it around your arm. I made a electrically actuated locking mechanism that automatically locks it shut. How fun! Now you can't escape :)</p>

  <p>these are initial wireframes of the different screens I made. Of course in the actual version many of the elements that you see are placed programmatically because they are interactable.</p>
  <p>These elements are all inspired by the super mario sprites used on the nintendo DS. Some of the fonts that we used were also from there.</p>
  <img src="hero2.png">
  <p>I designed the models in FreeCAD and printed them with PLA plastic.</p>

  <p>In total there were 3 complete design iterations of the product.</p>

  <p>I also designed the electronics myself. It includes connections to all external interfaces and a failsave latching system for the arm strap.</p>

  <img src="schematic3.png">
  <p>The enclosure was very small for all the different added functions. I was able to solder everything in place using dupont connectors.</p>
